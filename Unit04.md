*Once you have completed the recruitment process, it is crucial that you
properly train and develop your human capital.  As you go through this
unit, think of training as a process used to inform new members of the
specifics associated with the jobs that they have assumed.  Development
should be thought of as a continuous process of improvement and as an
opportunity to provide human capital with the updates and insight needed

mapping the career growth of your human capital and building strong
relationships between human capital and the management team.  Note:
Career planning is sometimes referred to as* succession planning*.*
