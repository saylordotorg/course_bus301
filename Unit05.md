**Unit 5: Performance Management and Measurement** <span id="5"></span> 
*In the last unit, you learned about human capital development and
training.  Mastering and applying this information is crucial to helping
you become more effective at identifying and creating a performance
management and measurement system.  Firms often use performance
management systems in order to properly identify the success of their
employees.  “Success” in the workplace is often defined by an
individual’s ability to live up to the demands of his or her position. 
With proper job analysis, it should be easy to quantify the level of
success or failure that each employee has reached.  However, it is
important to recognize that all humans are subject to certain
biases* – *leniency and the halo effect are good examples* – *when asked
to provide feedback.  (Leniency refers to a manager’s tendency to be
“too nice” out of fear of hurting the feelings of his or her employee. 
The halo effect refers to a situation in which a manager focuses on one
positive aspect of an employee’s performance as opposed to the
performance as a whole over the evaluation period.  The manager might,
for example, fixate on the fact that an employee obtained a high-profile
client or made a profitable sale, despite poor performance in all other
aspects of the job.)  Employees should be made aware of such tendencies
in order to strive toward a more balanced evaluation process.*  
  
 *Meanwhile, in a performance appraisal, one employee (frequently a
manager) reviews the performance of another employee.  Many successful
firms (including Infosys, one of the largest IT companies in India) use
what are known as “360 degree reviews.”  In the 360 degree review, the
employee also reviews the manager.  Firm managers should explore various
types of appraisal systems in order to determine which fits best with
the firm’s culture and strategy.*

     Instructions: Watch this lecture, which explains the difference
    between performance management and performance appraisal.  To
    effectively manage human capital, you must know the difference
    between the two.  In short, performance management (PM) is a system
    designed to integrate with the strategy of a firm; it must be valid
    and universal.  The performance appraisal (PA) is the actual,
    real-time review of an individual within the firm.  Consider it
    metaphorically: the PM system is like an interstate highway while
    the appraisal is just one car on the highway.  That car needs the
    right signs, speed limits, and proper road quality to have a
    successful trip.  After viewing the video, try to write a brief
    paragraph that summarizes the differences between performance
    management and performance appraisal.  
      
     Watching this lecture and writing your paragraph should take
    approximately 15 minutes.
