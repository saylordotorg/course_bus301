**Unit 6: Compensation and Benefits** <span id="6"></span> 
*When an employer is making a hiring decision, he or she must consider a
number of factors, including the cost of compensating human capital.  In
most cases within a business, this is the highest overhead cost consumed
by an organization.  Because poor financial planning is one of the top
10 risk factors associated with business failure, it is extremely
important that an employer understands the many elements associated with
the development and application of a compensation program.  An employer
must also be aware of compensation, as it is a tool used to attract and
retain human capital.  At different stages of an employee’s life, he or
she will have different workplace needs.  An organization may have some
employees who value direct financial compensation and others who have an
immediate need for other, more indirect benefits, like tuition
reimbursement or child care.  The key is to understand the dynamics of a
compensation program and develop an organizational program that serves
the needs of the organization, as well as the human capital employed by
the organization.*  
  
 *In times of recession, there is usually a larger labor force in search
of work.  This gives employers leverage when hiring; some can drive down
the associated human capital cost of employment due to the high supply
of labor.  However, the key to retaining good people in any environment,
including in periods of high growth, is usually compensation. 
Compensation is not just about a salary or bonus* –* it is about
work/life balance, perks, and contentment.  The happiest employees are
not necessarily the ones in the highest pay grade.  Often times, the
most successful companies pay less than their competitors because  they
have created an environment that is pleasant to work in.*  
  
 *Much of the chatter surrounding compensation today revolves around
executive pay, as the disparity between executive pay and employee pay
has grown dramatically over the decades.  This widening gap is largely
due to the fact that firms have been aligning executive compensation
with firm performance.  For publicly traded companies, performance is
often measured in terms of profitability or stock price performance. 
This system is problematic in that it incentivizes executives to take on
too much risk, as they are guaranteed compensation no matter what
happens.  This unit will explore this issue as well as others pertaining
to compensation and benefits.*
