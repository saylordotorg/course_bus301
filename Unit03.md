**Unit 3: Recruitment and Selection** <span id="3"></span> 
*Identifying the traits one will need for success in a position is
relatively easy compared to the daunting task of identifying those
traits within an applicant.  Given the cyclicality of unemployment, you
will likely receive a pile of resumes simply by posting an opening on a
company website or job board.  But how many of those resumes will be
worth looking through?  How many will be worth interviewing?  And will
any of them be the right person for the job?  You do not want to just
select the best person in the applicant pool; you want to find the best
person for the job.  Sometimes this means going beyond the normal labor
market and recruiting people currently employed at other firms.*  
  
 *There are a number of methods of recruiting the right talent.  Some
firms prefer to use specialized recruiting firms, while others ask their
current employees for recommendations.  The point is that a firm needs
to cast the widest net possible in order to secure a large applicant
pool.*  
  
 *Then, the firm must face the challenge of selecting the right
applicant by determining whether he or she possesses the KSAs discussed
in the last unit.  Like it or not, the interview method of selection is
one of the weakest forms of selection.  Critics argue that it is too
subjective. While subjectivity is not a bad thing, it must be paired
with the right objective measures.  This unit will cover a number of
such measures that can be useful in identifying candidates.  Please note
that interviews are still very important and that there are “right” and
“wrong” ways to conduct interviews, all of which will be addressed
here.*  
  
 *One of the key points to remember when recruiting and selecting human
capital is that you should identify individuals who share the company’s
ideas about the goals and objectives of its business.  You should work
to identify unique individuals with shared and complementary skill sets
in order to build an effective team.  Recruiting and selecting human
capital should be carried out in order to provide the organization with
a strategic advantage.*
