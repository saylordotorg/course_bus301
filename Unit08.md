**Unit 8: Labor and Employee Relations** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this final unit of the course, we will discuss labor and employee
relations and conclude with a brief perspective on how ethical concerns
pervade all aspects of human resource management.  As mentioned earlier
in the course, an employer wants to create an environment that is
attractive to potential and current employees.  As you have already
learned, the relationship between employer and employee can be a bit
tricky.  The employer has specific expectations when it makes the
decision to bring a new employee on board.  The employee has or should
have an expectation of the employer when he or she decides to join
and/or stay with an organization.  Sometimes, there are significant
discrepancies between what the employer needs/wants and what the
employee needs/wants.  In these situations, labor relations* – *or more
specifically, labor unions* – *can help strengthen the employer/employee
relationship.*  
  
 *Labor relations is a subfield of Human Capital Management concerned
with labor unions in the workplace.  Labor unions are independent third
parties that represent the collective interest of the employees within a
particular industry.  Just as a marriage counselor serves as a mediator
between a husband and a wife, a labor union seeks to balance the
differences between employer and employee.*  
  
 *Employee relations is a subfield of Human Capital Management concerned
with the prevention and/or resolution of workplace problems.  This
subfield encompasses poor performance and disciplinary action, the
identification and promotion of policies/procedures, and the
communication and promotion of awareness of the laws and legislation
that impact the managing of human capital.  These activities ensure that
efficiency, equity, and voice can be achieved in the workplace for both
the employer and the employee.  But what exactly do we mean by
efficiency, equity, and voice?*  
  
 *Efficiency relates to the ability to achieve a workplace goal with a
minimal or minimized investment of resources.  An employer seeks to
achieve efficiency by engaging the most productive human capital and
using the least amount of business resources.  An employee seeks to
achieve efficiency by asking for a specific balance between his or her
time contributions to the organization and the economic outputs provided
by the employer.  Both an employee and an employer want workplace
processes to be structured in such a way that each feels there is value
for what they are contributing.  Efficiency addresses the questions of:
am I getting an equal or opposite response to the amount of work I am
putting in?  Are you motivated to help me be successful?  Can I trust
that within our relationship, you have my best interest in mind?*  
  
 *Equity relates to the partnership ideal in the relationship between
the employer and the employee.  The key to understanding equity is
identifying with the fact that the business environment is typically not
a democracy.  An employer creates and enforces the workplace rules and
processes that it considers necessary to conducting business.  If an
employee works for this organization, the anticipation is for them to
comply, as employers typically make them aware of these expectations. 
Is the workplace environment stable and fair?  Is there room to grow and
do more?  Am I treated like a subordinate or a true partner?  These are
just some of the questions asked when assessing the equity in the
relationship between the employer and the employee.*  
  
 *In personal relationships, there are times when one person feels that
the other is not listening.  The same applies to the relationship
between employer/employee.  Employees typically want to work for an
employer who enables them to be heard and to contribute to the
functioning of the organization.  An employer wants an organization in
which employees have actively listened to and engaged in the proper
application of any workplace rules, processes, and procedures, with
minimal to no infraction.  In both cases, the employee and employer are
looking to “achieve voice” in their organizations.  Most, if not all,
organizations try to assist in the achievement of voice by providing
hotlines for employees to communicate, implementing suggestion boxes for
the anonymous submission of ideas or comments about the workplace
environment, and establishing an open door policy.  Because the employer
is the more dominant partner in this relationship, the balance between
efficiency, equity, and voice can appear to be a bit one sided; this is
where labor and employee relations step in.*  
  
 *Ethical conduct requires us to ask difficult questions.  Firms need to
make the distinction between legal compliance and ethical decision
making. Ethical lapses have been responsible for U.S. companies losing
billions of dollars in class action law suits.  Individual employees
must also take responsibility to adhere to their firms’ codes of 
conduct, codes of ethics, and various policies written to protect the
employee, the company, the community and other entities their
organization serves  Articles below describe some of the issues and
challenges faced by human resource professionals today to ensure these
codes of conduct, codes of ethics and company policies are disseminated,
acknowledged and  followed and accurately reflect the values and mission
of their firms.*
