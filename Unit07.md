**Unit 7: Safety and Health** <span id="7"></span> 
*By now, you should more fully understand the significance of managing
human capital as a strategic part of any business platform.  It is
important that you recognize how all of the human capital management
concepts come together to support an organization that enjoys a
competitive advantage over others within its market.  It is also
important that you understand that the employer is responsible for
making the job attractive to potential human capital candidates and
enticing them with an environment that incentivizes employees to work
and grow with the organization. While you have covered a lot as this
course has progressed, there are still some key factors to be addressed
as you develop an understanding of how to manage human capital.  One of
those key areas is the safety and health of human capital.*  
  
 *At a most basic level, the employer is responsible for sending its
employees home in the same manner in which they arrived.  The concept of
safety is so important that the government has created a special
department* – *the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA)* – *whose sole focus is the safety and well-being of employees
within the workplace. Every single workplace environment must comply
with OSHA regulations.*  
  
 *Employers must also be concerned with the health of their human
capital.  Healthy employees boost workplace performance and
productivity, use fewer sick day benefits, and are more likely to build
stronger and longer-lasting relationships with their employers.  When an
employee or potential employee sees that an employer is concerned about
his or her personal well-being, he or she is more likely to become and
remain a part of that organization.  Note: Employee Health is sometimes
referred to as employee wellness.*
