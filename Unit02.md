**Unit 2: Staffing the Organization: Job Analysis and Description**
<span id="2"></span> 
*Now that you understand the core components of strategy as applied to
managing human capital, learn how to identify the right human capital by
properly assessing and defining all of the jobs within an organization. 
Identifying the right people for a firm can be very difficult.  To make
things more challenging, job descriptions often do a poor job of
detailing the employment environment.  By conducting a proper job
analysis of all roles within a firm, hiring managers can better identify
the traits they need a future employee to possess for a specific job.*  
  
 *Employers seek employees with traits that fall into one of four
categories: Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Other Characteristics. 
Collectively, these traits are referred to as KSAs.  The keys to success
lay not in an individual’s experience with Microsoft Office or his or
her ability to work in a high stress environment, but rather in his or
her capacity to learn on the job, humility in admitting fault, and
temperament in a stressful situation.  In this unit, you will learn how
to identify the true demands of a job and translate them into an
accurate job description.*

**2.3 A, B, and C Jobs – People (Human Capital)** <span
id="2.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: YouTube: Academic Earth: Dan Springer’s “Protecting Human
    Capital”**
    Link: YouTube: Academic Earth: Dan Springer’s [“Protecting Human
    Capital”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-fgNdk99Vw) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch this brief
    video, and then write a brief paragraph that summarizes the
    speaker’s main points.  This short video serves as an introduction
    to the value of human capital.  
      
     There can be such a thing as too many generals. When it comes to
    managing human capital, many organizations have a strategy for
    developing and nurturing their leaders.  However, to truly be
    successful at managing human capital, they must also be able to
    develop effective strategies for managing their employees.  
        
     You will note that Dan Springer uses the words *income statement*
    (a financial statement that illustrates the revenue and expenses a
    business has incurred over a specific period; the income/loss
    recorded on this statement should be monitored on a regular basis,
    usually daily, to ensure the business is profitable) and *balance
    sheet* (a financial statement illustrating a company’s assets,
    liabilities, and owner’s equity).  
      
     One of the major goals of a business should be to increase asset
    value.  When managing human capital, you may find that certain
    C-jobs and C-employees and even certain B-jobs and B-employees have
    the greatest impact on your income statement.  The daily functions
    that these employees perform to support an organization as it works
    to meet its goals and objectives are most often the most important. 
    The A-jobs and employees are those with a high degree of risk (asset
    or liability), which makes their impact on the organization more
    strategic in nature.   
      
     Watching this video and writing a summary paragraph should take
    approximately 15 minutes.
