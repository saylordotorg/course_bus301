Course Syllabus for "BUS301: Human Resource Management"
-------------------------------------------------------

US firms maintain their competitive advantages by holding on to
resources their competitors cannot obtain.  What do we mean by
“resources?”  The term “resources” can refer to anything from rights to
a certain oil field, the patent on touchscreen technology, or an
exclusive contract with the government.  More often than not, however, a
company’s most valuable resources are its employees.  Often, having the
“right” employees – the individuals capable of developing iPhones or
finding new oil fields – separates the highly successful firms from
their less successful competitors.  As you begin the journey of this
course, you might be saying to yourself, "My company may say I am its
most valuable resource, but it really do not treat me like I am
valued."  This feeling is one of many elements associated with managing
human capital. In the United States, the subfield of Human Resource
Management (alternatively known as Human Capital Management) has a
history that dates back almost a century, but the most strategic
components of this course emerged as a result of transitions in the
workforce in the late 1960s.  After the passing of Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, all organizations were mandated by the Federal
Government to adhere to specific laws, which governed how an
organization should respond to and treat their human capital.  The
transition of women and minorities into the workplace and their
resulting contributions to business success incentivized organizations
to develop a better understanding of how to integrate all employees into
a culture that would reinforce and support the vision and mission of a
business. Human Resource Management refers to the practice of
strategically allocating the most valuable resources – people – to the
right areas of a firm.  This practice involves careful strategizing,
good leadership, and other solid business practices.  Human Resource
Management requires more than a strong human resources department; it
requires smart, capable team managers working in conjunction with an HR
department to carry out common goals. The key to understanding and
applying the concepts of this course revolves around learning how to
become uncomfortable.  What exactly does that mean?  Every one of us has
a core belief system shaped by our individual experiences, situations,
and circumstances.  This belief system informs and guides our
perceptions (i.e. what we believe is or is not valid/applicable to the
situation or circumstance with which we are dealing).  We naturally
gravitate towards those things with which we have some understanding,
and we have an intrinsic bias against those things that do not make
sense to us, that we perceive as unethical, or that make us
uncomfortable.  To effectively manage human capital, you have to learn
how to step outside of your comfort zone and make strategic decisions in
the best interest of the company, rather than those that make you
"comfortable." You know the basics of managing human capital from your
Principles of Management course
([BUS208](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bus208/)), but this course will
introduce you to more advanced topics in the field.  You will learn that
identifying the best employees begins with identifying the firm’s needs
and carrying out a proper recruitment and selection process.  Training,
development, and performance evaluations can then shape the selected
employee into an ideal firm resource.  Finally, adequate and
incentivizing compensation can keep those resources with the firm.  This
course will cover all these topics and more. Though you may not be
planning to pursue a career in human resource management, much of your
career success will depend upon working with the right people.  This
course will help you appreciate and leverage this fact.

free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

    the [U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
    Commission](http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/index.cfm)

 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
In each unit of this course, there is strategic information provided to
support your understanding of managing human capital.  It is very
important that you take notes as you work through the completion of this
course, and use these notes to support your critical analysis of the
assessments completed within each unit.  You will also need to complete
the following:  

-   Unit 1 Matching Assessment 
-   Unit 1 Quiz
-   Unit 2 Job Analysis
-   Unit 2 Job Description Assessment
-   Unit 3 Quiz
-   Unit 4 Training and Development Assessment
-   Unit 5 Quiz
-   Unit 6 Compensation Assessment
-   Unit 6 Quiz
-   Unit 7 OSHA Assessment
-   Unit 8 Labor History and Unions Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and assessments listed above.  Most of the
assessments contain grading rubrics, or tools that will help you grade
your own work.  While scoring high on an assessment is a great
incremental measure, your ultimate goal should be to retain the
information presented in the course.  In order to “pass” this course,
you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the Final Exam.  Your score on
the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If you do not
pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **87.75
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 17 hours.  To make the
process of completing Unit 1 more manageable, you are greatly encourage
to block out time over the course of a specified period, like a calendar
week, and schedule yourself to work through a specific subunit on each
day.  There is also a matching assessment and a quiz in Unit 1, both
designed to examine your comprehension and synthesis of the material in
this unit.  For example, Unit 1 takes approximately 17 hours to
complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with a calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday; subunit 1.2 (a
total of 4 hours) on Tuesday; etc.
