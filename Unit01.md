**Unit 1: The Nature of Managing Human Capital** <span id="1"></span> 
*People are a firm’s most valuable resource, and many of the most
successful firms proudly profess this fact in recruitment materials,
press events, and statements of their corporate values.  Human Resource
Management has been a focus in corporate strategy for the last
half-century, especially in light of the emergence of a service-based
economy* *(whereby most firms today provide services as opposed to the
products produced by firms in the past).*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn about the role that Human Capital
Management plays within any organization.  You will also review a
variety of major topics pertaining to human capital, including the
nature of HR management, strategies for HR management and planning, the
legal framework for equal employment as it applies to managing
diversity, and the application of affirmative action.  Some of these
subjects are so complex and diverse that they deserve their own
courses.  For example, the field of Managing Equal Employment and
Diversity is so broad that the US federal government has created the*
*Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to ensure that
individuals receive equal treatment in employment-related activities. 
These topics will be touched upon in this unit to so that you can focus
on the core of human capital management in the remaining units.*

     Note that the concept of Affirmative Action was first mentioned by
    President Kennedy in the early 1960s.  Affirmative Action is a
    response to the continuation of discrimination in all aspects of
    managing human capital after the passing of civil rights laws and
    the guarantees established by the [United States
    Constitution](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html).

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this brief
    article, which introduces various perspectives on affirmative
    action.  In the beginning of this course, we touched upon the
    concept of perception.  Perceptions inform and support the way in
    which we make decisions.  For example, when you are making a hiring
    decision about an employee belonging to a specific work group, your
    perceptions of and dealings with this particular type of person, as
    well as the situations or circumstances in which your interactions
    took place, will shape how you go about making this decision.  This
    analysis of affirmative action will force you to look at the
    discussion from both sides.
